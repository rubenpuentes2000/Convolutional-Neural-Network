# Convolutional Neural Network Definition
A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data. CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to 
recognize objects, classes, and categories. They can also be quite effective for classifying audio, time-series, and signal data.

# CNN Project
This project firsts loads and returns training and test datasets imported from the keras library, then defines the CNN model. 
The model can be evaluated with the evaluate function and saved as a .h5 file. From there any handdrawn image of a number can 
be loaded and predicted with the .h5 file of the CNN model.
